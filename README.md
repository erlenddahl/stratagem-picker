# Stratagem Picker

A simple tool for randomizing your Helldivers 2 game.

This tool allows you to randomly select your loadout for Helldivers 2, including primary and secondary weapons, grenades, stratagems, and a booster. You can re-roll each item individually or all at once, and lock specific items to keep them fixed during re-rolls.

Note that I have a quite poor overview of the total item pool, so if I have forgotten anything, mixed up the warbonds in any way, or made any other mistakes, please let me know!
